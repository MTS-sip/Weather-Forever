Note: BCS Tutoring transfer of knowledge concerning Render's Python vs Node settings; and package.json `render-build` possible loops (delete: '&& cd server && node dist/server.js' ). Missing characters, specifically '/data/2.5' in weatherService.ts at line 96, and argument inversion (!response.ok) to (response.ok) line 58

## User Story

- AS A traveler
  I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
  SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs

- WHEN I search for a city

  THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city, and that city is added to the search history

- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city

  THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, a description of the weather for the icon's alt tag, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city

  THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

- WHEN I click on a city in the search history

  THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

- WHEN I click on the trash can icon next to a city in the search history

  THEN the city is removed from the search history
